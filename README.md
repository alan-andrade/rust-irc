# Irc client with rust

This is another of my exercises to learn Rust.

I always wanted an IRC client that could have N amount of vertically
splited panes. I want this to be the default setting.

# Contribute

My plan is tu use ncurses for the pane splitting. It could be with
something else, but I'd like to keep it simple for now.
